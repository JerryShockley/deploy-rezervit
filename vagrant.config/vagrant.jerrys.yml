# The values shown below may need to vary from machine to machine,
# so we take the approach of creating a YAML file containing
# the configuration variables which may need to differ from
# one developer machine to the next. To keep a consistant
# Vagrant file we isolate these changes by creating a
# vagrant.<USER>.yml file in a subdirectory of the directory
# containing this Vagrantfile. The subdirectory is named:
# 'vagrant.config'.
#
# The <USER> portion of the filename above should be
# retrieved from the system environment variable 'USER'.
# You can check the value of your 'USER' environment
# variable by typing the command  'echo $USER' at
# the command prompt. If your value is not set please
# set it to your login name on your computer.
#
# The Ruby script at the top of this Vagrant file will
# inspect the system environment variable 'USER', which
# is set for most users, and determining the second part
# of the yaml config filename to open your personal vagrant
# configuration file everytime vagrant runs.
#
# To create your own personal Vagrantfile configuration file just
# copy the one already in the vagrant.config directory and customize
# the options the differ for you. This file should be added to
# the Git repository.

# Your local source directory that will be synced to gfolder
# on your guest OS inside VirtualBox. This enables you to edit
# the program files local on the host OS and the changes are
# automatically reflected in the guest OS.
hfolder: '/Users/jerrys/src/rezervit/'
# HTTP port number used on the host OS outside the guestOS.
# In other words gport is forwarded to hport and you use
# hport to connect from the host OS.
hport: '8080'
# DB port number used on the host OS outside the guestOS.
# Ensure this port number is available.
dbhport: '5436'
# Nodejs debug port on the host OS outside the guestOS.
debugport: '9229'
